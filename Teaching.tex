			\subsubsection*{Summary of Quantitative Evaluations for Courses as Teaching Assistant}
			At the conclusion of each semester, students are encouraged to submit evaluations for their enrolled courses. Each student can rate instructors and teaching assistants on a scale of 1 to 5 (with 5 being the highest) for the following questions:
			\begin{itemize}
					\item ``Overall, how effective was the instruction you received from this teaching assistant?'' (for Fall 2016 and beyond)
					\item ``How helpful and responsive was the teaching assistant?''
					\item ``How knowledgeable was the teaching assistant about the subject matter of this class?''
			\end{itemize}
			The table below summarizes student responses to these questions for the courses I served as a teaching assistant. Average scores on a scale of 1 to 5 are presented for each course along with the departmental average in parenthesis. The Effective question was not asked and departmental averages are not available prior to the Fall of 2016.\\

			[Table here]

			\subsubsection*{Qualitative Responses for Courses as Teaching Assistant}
			In addition to the quantitative responses, students are given an opportunity to provide open-ended qualitative responses. For Fall of 2016 and beyond, students were asked:
			\begin{itemize}
					\item ``What aspects of this teaching assistant's teaching were most helpful to you?''
					\item ``How can this teaching assistant's teaching be improved?''
			\end{itemize}
			For courses prior to the Fall of 2016, students were asked for ``general comments about the teaching assistant.'' The responses to these questions are presented in full below. Responses containing the following were deleted: N/A, n/a, NA, na, none, nothing, not applicable. Professor names have also been removed.\\
